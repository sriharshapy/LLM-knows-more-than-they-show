## Overview

This repository contains the codebase for the extended experiments based on the paper "LLMs Know More Than They Show" by Hadas et al. Our work focuses on analyzing hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) within the medical domain. We utilized the MedQuAD dataset and extended the original code to work with the LLAMA 3.2 1B model, incorporating LoRA fine-tuning to enhance the model's medical knowledge.

## Repository Structure
